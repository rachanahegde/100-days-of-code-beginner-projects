<h1> Beginner Projects from 100 Days of Code</h1>
Note: All of the code was originally written and run in replet and I haven't saved all the corresponding art files (containing the logos and ASCII art) for each of the games. This repository mainly exists to document my progress and my learning through each project I've completed during the bootcamp.

An choose your adventure game where you search for hidden treasure and possibly die in the process.

<h3> Password Generator </h3>

<h3> Hangman Game </h3>
The user can guess a letter in a randomly chosen word until they lose all six lives or figure out the word and win! 

<h3> Caesar Cipher </h3>
A program that enables you to encrypt and decrypt messages so that if the message is intercepted, it'll just read like gibberish to a stranger.
