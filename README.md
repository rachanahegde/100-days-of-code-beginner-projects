<h1> Beginner Projects from 100 Days of Code</h1>
Note: All of the code was originally written and run in replit and I haven't saved all the corresponding art files (containing the logos and ASCII art) for each of the games. This repository mainly exists to document my progress and my learning through each project I've completed during the bootcamp.  

<h3> Treasure Island </h3>
An choose your adventure game where you search for hidden treasure and possibly die in the process.

<h3> Password Generator </h3>
Generates a password with the order of characters randomised.

<h3> Hangman Game </h3>
The user can guess a letter in a randomly chosen word until they lose all six lives or figure out the word and win! 

<h3> Caesar Cipher </h3>
A program that enables you to encrypt and decrypt messages so that if the message is intercepted, it'll just read like gibberish to a stranger.

<h3> Silent Auction </h3>
A group of people can each enter their name and bid (secretly!) and the program will select the highest bidder. 

<h3> Calculator </h3>
Literally a calculator. 

<h3> Blackjack Game </h3>
This blackjack game was the first capstone project for this bootcamp and it really tested my knowledge and my patience! I decided to share the code that I originally wrote - before watching her solution videos - and I completed the standard difficulty version of this project (which still took me 6 hours). Python Tutor's visualisation feature helped me fix some major bugs.
